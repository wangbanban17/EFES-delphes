                        !+1+ This list of nine magistrates was originally inscribed on a wall-block at the corner of the Athenian Treasury in the Sanctuary of Apollo Pythios at Delphi (on Attic inscriptions at Delphi, see <a href="/inscription/IGII34/17" class="highlight"><i>IG</i> II<sup>3</sup> 4, 17</a> with notes and on the Athenian Treasury, see below). Col. 1 was on the southern façade, while col. 2 was on the eastern face of the southern <i>anta</i>.</br></br>
                        The magistrates named in this inscription had organized the second attested <i>Pythais</i> of the Hellenistic period, which took place in 128/7 BC. The <i>Pythais</i> was an official Athenian pilgrimage to Delphi, which had taken place irregularly in the Classical period (see <a href="/inscription/IGII34/18" class="highlight"><i>IG</i> II<sup>3</sup> 4, 18</a> with notes), but was revived on a grand scale in the second half of the second century BC, now featuring hundreds of participants, who held a procession along the Sacred Way, performed sacrifices, and held games at Delphi. Documents for four <i>Pythaides</i> were inscribed on the Treasury (138/7, 128/7, 106/5, and 97/6 BC; for a complete list of <i>Pythais</i>-related inscriptions at Delphi, see I. Rutherford, <i>State Pilgrims and Sacred Observers in Ancient Greece</i>, 2014, 226-28, tab. 8). The lists of magistrates organizing the other <i>Pythaides</i>, equivalent to this list, are <i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 4-5 (106/5 BC), <i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 2 and 6 (97/6 BC). For the second <i>Pythais</i>, various groups of participants were inscribed on various blocks, seemingly arranged at random: magistrates (this text), official visitors (<i>theoroi</i>, <a href="/inscription/FDIII2/8" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 8</a>), Pythaist-boys (<a href="/inscription/FDIII2/12" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 12</a>), ephebes (<a href="/inscription/FDIII2/24" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 24</a>), cavalrymen (<a href="/inscription/FDIII2/27" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 27</a>), and victors in games (<a href="/inscription/FDIII2/34" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 34-42</a>). For the other three <i>Pythais</i> there was also a list of female basket-bearers (<i>kanephoroi</i>, <i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 29-31), but no such list for the second <i>Pythais</i> survived to us. The Treasury also bore other inscriptions related to the <i>Pythais</i>, such as honorific decrees from Delphi for an individual who helped organize the procession (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 33), an equestrian association (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 46), and probably for the association of Dionysiac artists (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 47), as well as two hymns that were performed during the procession (<a href="/inscription/PohlmannWest/20" class="highlight">Pöhlmann and West, <i>Greek Music</i> 20</a>-<a href="/inscription/PohlmannWest/21" class="highlight">21</a>). S. Tracy, <i>ALC</i> 172-75 argues that all the texts of the second <i>Pythais</i>, except <a href="/inscription/FDIII2/12" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 12</a>, were inscribed by the same cutter as several documents of the first <i>Pythais</i> (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 7, 11, 23, 29). The thickened serifs at the end of terminal strokes are typical of Athenian lettercutters. On the lettercutter(s), see <a href="/inscription/FDIII2/3" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 8</a> with notes.<br/><br/>
                        The Treasury of the Athenians was situated at the corner of the first turn on the Sacred Way towards the Temple of Apollo Pythios. For a detailed description of its architectural features, see J.-F. Bommelaer, <i>Guide de Delphes. Le site</i>,<sup>2</sup>2015, 159–162. On its construction and earlier history see <a href="/inscription/IGI3/1463" class="highlight"><i>IG</i> I<sup>3</sup> 1463</a> with notes.
                        Although the Treasury was erected in the late sixth or early fifth century BC, inscriptions only began to be added to it in the early third century BC. There are more than a hundred of them, dating from the early third century BC to the sixth century AD, mostly relating to Athens and inscribed before 80 BC (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 2–157). Some texts were inscribed on the east side of the Treasury (both <i>antai</i>, the architrave, and the stylobate) from the mid-third century BC. Most were inscribed on the southern façade of the Treasury, from 150 BC onwards. Eight Delphian manumission records of the late second century appear on the northern façade, which is not visible from the Sacred Way (on this type of documents, cf. <a href="/inscription/CIDV/534" class="highlight"><i>CID</i> V 534</a> with notes). A large number of texts are about Athenian ceremonies, especially the <i>Pythais</i> (see above) and the <i>Dodekais</i> (<i>F.Delphes</i> III.2, 59-66); but there are also records of interstate arbitration in favour of the Athenian Dionysiac artists (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 68–70), honours and privileges granted to the Marathonic Tetrapolis (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 18–22), as well as proxeny decrees for Athenians and other Greeks (<i>F.Delphes</i>, 76–96).!

                        !+4+ Comparison with the better-preserved magistrate list of the fourth <i>Pythais</i> (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 2) indicates that the missing lines named further magistrates, such as the chief official visitor (<i>architheoros</i>), who led the 11 official visitors (<i>theoroi</i>) in <a href="/inscription/FDIII2/8" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 8</a>. On <i>architheoros</i>, see <a href="/inscription/FDIII2/24"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 24</a> with notes. S. Tracy, <i>BCH</i> 99, 1975, 188-89 proposed that <i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 56α (add. p. 542-43) could belong to this name list. However, that fragment and its restoration seem to mark the beginning of a new text, rather than a continuation.!

!+2+ A large part of ll. 1-2 was re-inscribed with smaller letters over a preexisting text which is now illegible. The cutter responsible for the reinscription is different from the rest of this text (G. Colin, <i>Culte d'Apollon Pythien</i>, 1905, 32).!

!+3+ The text was aligned to the left, but the letters on l. 6 were distributed with proportional interspaces, so as to align the text in a space of 24 letters. This line thus would have served as a headline of the court presidents (<i>thesmothetai</i>) mentioned in the following lines.!

!+4+ Comparison with the better-preserved magistrate list of the fourth <i>Pythais</i> (<i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 2) indicates that the missing lines named further magistrates, such as the chief official visitor (<i>architheoros</i>), who led the 11 official visitors (<i>theoroi</i>) in <a href="/inscription/FDIII2/8" class="highlight"><i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 8</a>. S. Tracy, <i>BCH</i> 99, 1975, 188-89 proposed that <i>F.Delphes</i> III 2, 56α (add. p. 542-43) could belong to this name list. However, that fragment and its restoration seem to mark the beginning of a new text, rather than a continuation.!
